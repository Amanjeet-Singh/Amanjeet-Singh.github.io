          <p>Now that we know what a website, or more specifically, what a webpage is, things are a tiny bit clearer, but we still have a long way to go. These webpages still have to get to the browser somehow, to be displayed on our screens, but how do they get to the browser? Are all the websites of the world stored in our own computers in html files that we can access? or are they being sent to our browser through the internet from somewhere? Where are they being sent from? How are they being sent to us? These questions are vital to understanding how websites are accessed and displayed in our browsers and below I will answer them.</p>

          <h2 class="section-heading">Languages for Web Design</h2>
          <p>There are two languages used in webpage develpoment that define the structure and design of the page itself. As we already know, HTML is a markup language, it does not contain 'logic' elements as used in programming languages. HTML is used to set up the structure of the page, but HTML by itself is not an ideal way to design a webpage, most people don't want to see a webpage with just a structure and text. To design the page as we want, we must also use another language of sorts, known as Cascading Style Sheets, popularly known as CSS. The design is achieved by making a separate file with the extension .css which is linked to the html file. CSS can allow us to design the webpage in various ways by adding colors, divisions, and many other styling elements.</p>
  
      <h2 class="section-heading">JavaScript</h2>
          <p>JavaScript, commonly referred to as js, is a scripting language that goes along with webpages. This programming language runs on the browser itself and is used to create responsive and dynamic interfaces that change based on the device or browser accessing it, and on user input/actions. It is the most popular language used in web development because of the functionality it brings to the webpage structure and design, allowing for many of the new features we see on sites today.</p>

      <h2 class="section-heading">Server-Side Languages</h2>
          <p>There are many server-side languages to keep the website functioning and for many of the tasks associated with deploying and maintaining websites. 
            <ul>
            <li>The most popular one is node.js. node.js is a server-side language built in JavaScript, thus allowing for easy integration between the JavaScript on the webpage and the one supposed to run on the server.</li> 
            <li>Another popular server language is PHP which is also an excellent and easy to use language on the server-side.</li> 
            <li>Python is also another programming language used in web development, although not as popular as the others, it is still used a lot. It can also be paired with frameworks to do front-end coding as well.</li>
            <li>Ruby is an older language, but it is still considered to be among the discussion of server side languages because of its great functionality and conveniency. Like Python, it can also m</li>
            </ul>
          </p>

      <h2 class="section-heading">Other Languages</h2>
          <p>Besides the ones mentioned above, there are many other languages used in web development that aren't as popular or of use in web development but should still be mentioned
            <ul>
              <li>ASP.NET is a server-side language created in 2002, although not many, but a few sites still run it.</li>
              <li>C# takes the object-oriented programming of C++ further and can be used for server-side applications, but it is mainly used in games and application along with the Unity engine.</li>
              <li>Java, not to be confused with JavaScript, is another programming language that can be used in web development. It is mostly used to develpo apps for Android devices.</li>
              <li>Swift, is another programming language used to build applications and interfaces in iPhones and iPads. It is used in development and design of iPhone apps and games.</li>
            </ul>
          </p>
